# Students-Performance-ML
This project uses machine learning techniques to classify students based on their academic performance. It aims to identify patterns and predict performance categories.
Steps:
⦁	Import Data
⦁	Exploratory Data Analysis
⦁	Check Missing Values
⦁	Composition of Features
⦁	Data Visualization
⦁	Data Distribution
⦁	Comparison Target vs Features
⦁	Correlation
⦁	Data Preprocessing
⦁	Encoding Categorical Variable
⦁	Model Train & Test split
⦁	Machine Learning Algorithms
⦁	Apply Classification Models
	1. Logistic Regression
	2. Decision Tree Classifier
	3. Gaussian NB
	4. Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
	5. Random Forest Classifier
⦁	Apply Matrix for Evaluation Model
	1. Confusion Matrix
	2. Precision
	3. Recall
	4. F1 Score
⦁	Generate Classification Report
